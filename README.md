# folder_cleanup_script
A simple python script to clean up files in a folder specified by a command line argument. 

Not a fantastic script yet it takes the file extension and year the file was made and makes a directory for those types of files.
The script skips directories and irregular files.

To run the file just type in the terminal
  >python CleanScript.py directory
  
The script will then run on the specified directory.
